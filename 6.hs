--The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
--1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

--The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
--(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

--Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of
--the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum
--is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

--Find the difference between the sum of the squares of
--the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
